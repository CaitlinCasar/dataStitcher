Stitch images and data from coupled SEM/XEDS


This script stitches SEM images and corresponding XEDS data into raster bricks in R. The script requires xy coordinates for the bottom left corner of the SEM images. One way to obtain these coordinates is by using the photomerge script in Photoshop. 

Here is an example rock surface SEM image, purple box outlines a high resolution transect region:
